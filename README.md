Interpretation of Doctor's Handwriting
The handwriting recognition system is implemented using Python. Modules such as Opencv and Tensorflow are used.We are going to build a Handwriting Recognition System using a Neural Network to train the dataset. It consists of convolutional NN (CNN) layers, recurrent NN (RNN) layers and a final Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layer.
The IAM Dataset is first preprocessed.The Preprocessing methods will enhance the input images and then simplify the problem for the classifier.
